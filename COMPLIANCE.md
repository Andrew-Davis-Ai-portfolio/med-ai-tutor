# P.AI Index™ — Regulatory Compliance Position Paper v1.0

**Jurisdiction:** United States — State of Delaware  
**Effective Date:** Upon Public Access  
**Principal:** Andrew Davis — CAIO + CAIIP  

---

## 1. Non-Clinical Classification

P.AI Index™ is explicitly and solely classified as:

✅ Educational Simulation Software  
❌ Not Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)

The System does **not**:
- Diagnose or treat conditions  
- Guide clinical interventions  
- Perform triage or prioritize care  
- Influence patient safety decisions  
- Require FDA/EMA regulatory clearance  

---

## 2. Legal & Regulatory Anchors

This classification is aligned with:

📌 **FDA** — “Clinical Decision Support Software” Guidance  
📌 **HIPAA** — Privacy Rule & Security Rule exceptions  
📌 **HITECH Act** — Non-PHI systems exclusion  
📌 **ONC Cures Act** — Non-diagnostic status  
📌 **AMA AI Policy** — Human oversight mandate

The System avoids all regulated capabilities.

---

## 3. Prohibited Use Disclosures

Users are strictly prohibited from:
- Entering real patient data  
- Using outputs for care decisions  
- Presenting System responses as medical advice  

Violation of this rule fully transfers liability to the user.

---

## 4. Oversight & Control Principles

The System enforces:
- Mandatory human clinical judgment  
- Clear Emergency Use restrictions  
- Ethical guardrails against reliance  
- Simulation markers and disclaimers

---

## 5. Monitoring & Safety Development Roadmap

Future upgrades may include:
- Clinical-grade safety-validation layers  
- Regulatory partner review  
- Human oversight automation  
- Institutional pilot programs

Any regulated path will include:
- Risk Management documentation  
- IRB evaluation  
- SaMD regulatory notification  

Until then, the System remains **strictly non-clinical**.

---

## 6. Public & Transparent Governance

All key protections are documented in:
- `/LEGAL.md`
- `/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- `/TERMS_OF_USE.md`
- `/RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`

Stakeholders can verify compliance openly via GitHub.
