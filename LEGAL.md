1. Purpose & Scope

This Agreement defines the permitted purpose, usage restrictions, responsibilities, liability boundaries, and compliance expectations associated with the access, testing, demonstration, and continued development of the educational artificial intelligence software known as P.AI Index™ (“System”).

The System is intended exclusively as a simulation and education-only environment for exploring clinical decision-support models, medical ethics reasoning, healthcare workflow automation, and responsible AI governance principles.

This Agreement establishes:
	•	The non-clinical, non-advisory nature of the System
	•	The lack of any duty of care to users or third parties
	•	The requirement of human professional oversight for any interpretation
	•	The proactive mitigation of regulatory and safety risks
	•	The indemnified status of the Protected Principal

Any user accessing the System acknowledges agreement to all terms herein.

⸻

2. Educational Simulation Intent Only

The System:
	•	Does not provide medical diagnosis
	•	Does not prescribe treatment, medication, device usage, or interventions
	•	Does not replace licensed clinical judgment
	•	Does not determine patient risk, triage priority, or outcome probability
	•	Does not meet the regulatory definition of “Software as a Medical Device”

All content presented by the System is fictional and designed solely for:

✔ Clinical roleplay
✔ Ethics training
✔ Workflow simulation
✔ Decision-reasoning education
✔ Healthcare policy exploration

Users confirm they will never:
	•	Apply System responses to real-world medical cases
	•	Modify System outputs into actionable medical guidance
	•	Allow any AI-generated text to influence treatment decisions

The P.AI Index™ exists to improve clinician education,
not to influence patient care.

⸻

3. Professional Oversight Requirement

The System requires licensed human oversight for any interpretation of content involving:
	•	Medical terminology
	•	Ethical scenarios
	•	Diagnostic pathways
	•	Procedural workflows
	•	Clinical risk evaluation

The System cannot be used to:
	•	Provide advice
	•	Perform triage
	•	Guide treatment
	•	Inform emergency decisions

Users understand and agree that emergency care must always defer to:

🚑 911 / emergency services
👩‍⚕️ Physicians / Licensed clinicians
🏥 Accredited hospitals & urgent response teams

⸻

4. No Duty of Care

The Protected Principal:

Assumes no duty of care
toward:
	•	Users
	•	Patients
	•	Healthcare institutions
	•	Any person interpreting or misapplying System content

The System does not:
	•	Establish a provider-patient relationship
	•	Imply medical authority or responsibility
	•	Trigger malpractice jurisdiction

All responsibility for use or interpretation lies fully with the user.

⸻

5. Risk Allocation & Indemnification

Users agree to:
	•	Assume all risks of use
	•	Waive any claim for damages
	•	Fully indemnify the Protected Principal for any legal action arising from misuse

This includes:
	•	Losses
	•	Injuries
	•	Misdiagnosis events
	•	Delays in receiving proper care
	•	Misinterpretation of fictional content

Users release the Protected Principal from all liability and claims, including:

direct, indirect, punitive, consequential, and incidental damages.

6. Data Protection & Privacy Framework

The System does not request, collect, store, transmit, analyze, or process any:
	•	Protected Health Information (PHI)
	•	Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
	•	Patient names, identifiers, medical records
	•	Real clinical device outputs or imaging
	•	Biometric or physiological signals

All scenarios and content are:

✔ Synthetic
✔ Hypothetical
✔ Fictionalized
✔ De-identified
✔ Non-clinical

Users agree to never input:
	•	Real patient data
	•	Confidential information
	•	Any identifiable health record

The System is inherently designed to remain outside the scope of:
	•	HIPAA Privacy Rule
	•	HIPAA Security Rule
	•	HITECH Act Breach Notification Rule
	•	GDPR Article 9 special data requirements

Any user who inputs PHI bears full responsibility and liability for doing so.

7. Third-Party Platform Operations

The System may operate on or be integrated with:
	•	GitHub Pages
	•	HuggingFace Spaces
	•	Web/mobile frameworks
	•	Local client machines
	•	Non-medical cloud hosting services

These platforms:
	•	Do not claim medical compliance
	•	Offer no PHI safeguards
	•	Do not certify clinical usage

Users acknowledge that use of third-party hosting:
	•	Does not alter the System’s non-clinical classification
	•	Does not confer any compliance guarantees

⸻

8. Emergency Escalation Directive

In any real medical situation:

🚫 The System must not be consulted
✅ Licensed professionals must be contacted
✅ Emergency services remain the required response path

If a user attempts to apply System content in real-life settings:
	•	Protected Principal is not responsible for consequences
	•	User assumed full liability at login

This is non-negotiable and cannot be modified by user action.

⸻

9. Regulatory Compliance Position

The System is not classified as:
	•	“Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)”
	•	Clinical Decision Support Software

It is designed to fall outside FDA, EMA, MHRA, Health Canada and similar regulations governing:
	•	AI in diagnosis
	•	Risk stratification
	•	Therapy selection
	•	Direct patient impact

Any future pathway into regulated space will require:
	•	Separate compliance review
	•	Clinical testing
	•	Institutional approvals
	•	Risk management documentation
	•	Updated versions of this Agreement

Until such upgrades occur, the System shall not be marketed as a medical product.
