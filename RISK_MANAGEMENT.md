# P.AI Index™ — AI Risk Management Framework v1.0

**Principal:** Andrew Davis — CAIO + CAIIP  
**Jurisdiction:** United States — Delaware  
**Purpose:** Define safety controls & ensure responsible operation  

---

## 1. Objective

This document identifies key risks associated with educational medical simulations and establishes mitigation strategies that prevent clinical misuse or patient harm.

---

## 2. Safety Principles

The System adheres to:

- **Human Oversight First** — Licensed clinicians required for any medical interpretation  
- **Restriction of Use** — No diagnosis, treatment, or triage  
- **Transparency** — Clear disclosures of non-medical status  
- **Privacy Minimalism** — Zero PHI collected  
- **Non-Reliance** — Content is fictional and must remain so  

---

## 3. Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Clinical Misuse | User may apply outputs to real patients | Mandatory disclaimers, legal enforcement, Terms of Use |
| Hallucination | AI may produce inaccurate content | Accuracy disclaimers, education-only classification |
| Emergency Reliance | User attempts emergency care guidance | Emergency-use prohibition notices |
| User Misinterpretation | Layperson may assume authority | Plain-language warnings displayed in UI |
| PHI Input | User enters real medical data | Strict prohibition, Privacy Policy enforcement |
| Feature Expansion | Future update looks clinical | Regulatory checkpoints before capability changes |

---

## 4. Oversight & Control Mechanisms

Safety is maintained by:

- **UI warnings** at every entry point  
- **Emergency directive** (“Call 911 / Contact professionals”)  
- **Access gate** requiring Terms & Legal acceptance  
- **Public documentation of guardrails**  
- **Audit-ready transparency**

---

## 5. Failure Response Procedure

If a feature or user action risks clinical classification:

1. **Disable** affected module  
2. **Notify** contributors and stakeholders  
3. **Assess** regulatory impact  
4. **Update** this framework  
5. **Re-open only if compliant**

---

## 6. Continuous Monitoring

Safety updates may include:

- Additional disclaimers  
- Expanded oversight prompts  
- Stricter PHI input validation  
- Improved hallucination notices  

The System will **never** prioritize functionality over safety.

---

## 7. Regulatory Escalation Path (Future Scope)

Only if pursuing clinical deployment:

- IRB partnerships  
- FDA SaMD documentation  
- Medical advisory board involvement  
- Bias audit and validation trials  

Until then → **Educational use only.**

## Statement of Intent

> “The purpose of P.AI Index™ is to improve understanding of medical workflows,  
> not to influence or replace real-world care.”

The Protected Principal takes responsible innovation seriously  
and enforces all limitations documented above.
